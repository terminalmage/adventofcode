            # be ideal if we could count up, left, down, and then right. So for

            # trivial and already in the example. We would have calculated the
            # nearest odd-square as 9. We know we need to count up seven to get
            # there. The correct starting point is the point diagonally down

            # length that we would move, in each direction for this spiral
            # layer. Well, we know that the next layer ends in 5Â² (25), so

            # each direction to get to the end of the new spiral layer. So,
